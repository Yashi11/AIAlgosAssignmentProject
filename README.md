# AIAlgosAssignmentProject

In this project, we aim to predict the marks of various students on th basis of their nuber of courses and total study hours. Same has been iplemented using SparkML algorithm:
DecisionTreeRegressionModel and GeneralizedLinearRegressionModel

# Decision Tree Algorithm in Spark
ontrasted with linear regression where the output is assumed to follow a Gaussian distribution, generalized linear models (GLMs) are specifications of linear models where the response variable Yi follows some distribution from the exponential family of distributions. Sparkâ€™s GeneralizedLinearRegression interface allows for flexible specification of GLMs which can be used for various types of prediction problems including linear regression, Poisson regression, logistic regression, and others. Currently in spark.ml, only a subset of the exponential family distributions are supported and they are listed below.
